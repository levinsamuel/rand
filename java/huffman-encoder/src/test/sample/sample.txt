Here is a string of text. Tell me the frequencies of this string, please.

Thanks.

2014-06-19: Now this file is longer. I am going to make this file much longer to see
if this causes any other undesired behavior. It probably will. When trying this
encoder on a much longer file what happened was that the file keep being written to endlessly
which probably indicates a serious problem. Definitely. DEEEEEEFFFFFFINITELY.

2014-06-24: Fixed an error caused by the fact that I was storing each encoded bit string as one
byte, but some ended up being longer than that. I made a fix where, depending on the length of
the bit string, it would be stored as either one or two bytes, and both writer and reader check
the length first. The test succeeded with this longer file, but the last two characters were cut off.

2014-06-24, same date but next day really: Error where file was being written to ad infinitum
is fixed. As expected, it was an issue with the logic around continuing onto a new bitset once
the the previous one hit the size limit. The iterator of the loop was being reset to 0 inside the
loop so I changed the loop to use its own iterator.
