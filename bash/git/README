Some scripts I've found, wrote, or modified for using git in a bash shell.

./git here is a kind of wrapper around git. What I do is put it in my HOME
directory and then put my HOME dir in my path ahead of everything else.
That way things in home are found first. This script will then scan your
PATH to find the next executable called "git" and use that to run commands
that are not custom commands.

custom commands are placed in $HOME/.mygit. This works with the modified
.git-completion.bash also in this directory.

TODO: make that path more easily configurable.
